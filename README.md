# RHEL-Scripts

This repository is mostly for me to practice my scripting skills prior to taking the RHCSA exam (scheduled for March 1st). However, I hope you find something helpful here!

# automated-backups

The real goal is for me to practice with the cron utility, creating archives, command line args I/O, and general scripting. However, the script also provides a simple way to scheduke a job to copy the entire user's profile directory (/home/USER/* or /root/*) to a backup location.
